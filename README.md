# manim-fourier-project
Adapted to write UDELAS as cool text.

Written in Python to draw cool things using the math of complex Fourier-series. This is an updated version of the code from youtuber Theorem of Beethoven, adapted from CairoManim to [ManimCE](https://www.manim.community/)

Inspired by brilliant math youtuber 3Blue1Brown, creator of the Manim Python library.
